# Liquidity Lens â€” A Saros DLMM Demo

This project, **Liquidity Lens**, is a comprehensive demo application developed for the Saros DLMM Hackathon. It serves as a practical showcase for leveraging the `@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk` to construct a robust, real-world application for managing liquidity within Saros's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) protocol.
The application provides users with tools to interact with DLMM pools on the Solana blockchain, offering functionalities that enhance liquidity provision and monitoring.

This project is built with Next.js (App Router), Bun, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Core Features

-   **Wallet Connection:** Connect your Phantom wallet (or any other wallet compatible with `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`).
-   **Pool Discovery:** Browse, search, filter, and sort from a list of available DLMM pools on Saros, with enriched information like current price and liquidity.
-   **Create Liquidity Position:** Open a new liquidity position with a custom price range. The app provides a real-time preview of estimated fees and liquidity distribution before you sign.
-   **Position Dashboard:** Track your active liquidity positions, monitor profit and loss (PnL), and visualize impermanent loss for each position.
-   **Impermanent Loss (IL) Chart:** A visual representation of impermanent loss, adapted to show the range of concentrated liquidity positions, built with Recharts.
